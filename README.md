In this project perform data cleaning, analyzing data, extracting insights and usage of OOPS function, libraries like PANDAS,NUMPY ETC and visualiazation.
Task 1: Budget & Range Filter
Filter EVs under 350,000 PLN and with â‰¥400 km range.
Group by manufacturer (Make).
Calculate average battery capacity for each manufacturer.
Task 2: Outlier Detection
Detect outliers in the mean energy consumption column ([kWh/100km]) using statistical methods (e.g., IQR or Z-score).
Task 3: Battery vs. Range Analysis
Visualize battery capacity vs. range (e.g., scatter plot).
Provide insights on relationship (e.g., correlation, trends).
Task 4: EV Recommendation System
Build a Python class to recommend top 3 EVs based on:
User input: budget, desired range, battery capacity.
Returns matching EVs sorted by a relevance score or price.
Task 5: Hypothesis Testing
Conduct a two-sample t-test comparing average engine power between Tesla and Audi.
State hypothesis, test result, p-value, and interpret insights.
